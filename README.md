# Kaggle_Competitions

This repository contains my personal submissions, experiments, and pipelines for various Kaggle competitions.

Each competition is structured as a standalone project with its own modular codebase, clean separation of experiments, and submission tracking.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Achieve **Top 10% or better** on the public leaderboard in each competition
- Build scalable, GPU-accelerated, and modular ML pipelines
- Track personal growth toward Kaggle Grandmaster and NVIDIA-ready engineering skill

##  Project Structure

Each competition is placed in its own folder with the following structure:

<competition_name>/
├── experiments/ # Training scripts, CV runners, inference
├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for EDA, prototyping
├── src/ # Core logic (models, datasets, utilities)
└── submissions/ # CSV files submitted to Kaggle

Example:
CMI-Detect_Behavior_with_Sensor_Data/
├── experiments/
├── notebooks/
├── src/
└── submissions/
